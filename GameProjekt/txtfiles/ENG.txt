[Intro]
Welcome to Power Simulator!
Thereâ€™s a lot of activity at Christiansborg leading up to the upcoming 2025 election, and your help is needed!
The Minister for the Environment wants to propose a draft for Denmarkâ€™s energy grid by 2030 as part of the Paris Agreement.
However, heâ€™s struggling to decide which direction to take when it comes to choosing energy sources.
Your task is to explore and determine which energy supply Denmark should use!

[AtomExpertIntro]
Welcome to the nuclear power plant!

My name is Nina Nucleus, and I am an expert in nuclear power, nuclear reactors, and energy production through fission.

We are in an energy production facility that generates energy using nuclear power. The nuclear power plant takes small amounts of uranium or other radioactive materials and splits them in a fusion process, releasing large amounts of energy.

[AtomExpertShortInfo]
Nuclear Power Plant:
Price: 5 billion DKK
Annual Energy Production: 1750 GWt
CO2 during establishment + first year: 500,000 tons
Stability: 90-95%
Capacity Factor: 90%
Lifespan: Minimum 60 years

[AtomExpertMoreInfo]
Advantages of Nuclear Power:
- High energy production: Produces 1750 GWt annually, enough to supply hundreds of thousands of households.
- Efficiency and stability: Capacity factor of 90% and stability of 90-95%, which exceeds solar and wind energy.
- CO2-neutral operation: Emits no greenhouse gases during electricity production, reducing the carbon footprint.
- Independent of weather: Provides stable energy all the time, regardless of wind and solar conditions.
- Technological improvements: Modern nuclear power plants have become safer and more efficient.

Disadvantages of Nuclear Power:
- Historical safety risks: Previous accidents like Chernobyl have caused fear and opposition to nuclear power.
- Radioactive waste: Waste from older power plants remains radioactive for thousands of years and requires extensive storage.
- High construction costs: Establishing nuclear power plants requires 500,000 tons of CO2, significant financial resources, and long-term planning.
- Political opposition: Nuclear power is not part of Denmark's power grid, mainly due to opposition from the 1970s and 1980s.



[WaterExpertIntro]
Welcome to the Hydroelectric Plant!

My name is Eddy E. Current, and I am a specialist in hydrology and hydroelectric technology.

A hydroelectric plant uses the movement of water, typically from falls or currents, to drive turbines that generate electricity.

[WaterExpertShortInfo]
Hydroelectric Plant:
Price: 310 million DKK
Annual Energy Production: 175 GWt
CO2 during establishment + first year: 20,000 tons
Stability: 40-60%
Capacity: 50%
Lifespan: About 200 years

[WaterExpertMoreInfo]
Advantages of Water Energy:
- Hydropower is stable and independent of the weather.
- Energy production can be regulated as needed.
- Only pollution during construction and decommissioning, but there is discussion on whether methane from the accumulation of plant material counts in emissions.

Disadvantages of Water Energy:
- Requires specific geographic conditions such as rivers and mountains with elevation differences.
- Can harm biodiversity by changing the flow of rivers.
- Maintenance of turbines and dams requires resources.
- High capital costs and long construction time.



[SolarExpertIntro]
Welcome to the Solar Park!

My name is Sunny Sol, and I am an expert in renewable energy, solar energy, and solar panel efficiency.

A solar power plant converts sunlight into electricity via solar panels, an inverter, and possibly batteries, so the power can be used at home or sent to the grid.

[SolarExpertShortInfo]
Solar Park:
Price: 370 million DKK
Annual Energy Production: 350 GWt
CO2 during establishment + first year: 5,000 tons
Stability: 10-25%
Capacity: 17%
Lifespan: About 30 years

[SolarExpertMoreInfo]
Advantages of Solar Energy:
- The sun is a renewable energy source, and we are unlikely to run out of it.
- Solar energy allows for storing and selling excess power.
- The plants require minimal maintenance, as a 15-degree tilt makes them self-cleaning and keeps operational costs low.

Disadvantages of Solar Energy:
- Solar power plants can be visually intrusive as they require large areas.
- Battery storage is expensive and environmentally burdensome with a shorter lifespan than the plants themselves.
- The production of solar panels requires rare metals such as silicon and silver, which can lead to environmental and resource-related challenges.



[WindExpertIntro]
Welcome to the Wind Farm!

My name is Wendy Windstorm, and I am a specialist in wind energy and wind farms.

Wind energy is harnessed through wind turbines that convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electricity via a generator. When the wind causes the blades to rotate, it drives a shaft that generates power.

[WindExpertShortInfo]
Wind Farm:
Price: 500 million DKK
Annual Energy Production: 350 GWt
CO2 during establishment + first year: 10,000 tons
Stability: 20-40%
Capacity Factor: 30%
Lifespan: About 15-25 years

[WindExpertMoreInfo]
Advantages of Wind Energy:
- CO2-neutral: Produces energy without emitting greenhouse gases and contributes to the green transition.
- Renewable resource: Wind is an unlimited energy source that can never run out.
- Energy production: An average wind farm produces 350 GWt annually.
- Economic benefit: Can be exported, and has low operational costs that can reduce energy prices.
- Denmark as a leader: Wind energy has been a significant part of Danish energy production since the 1980s.

Disadvantages of Wind Energy:
- High establishment costs: Offshore wind farms require large investments, typically around 500 million DKK.
- Visual and noise impact: Wind turbines can disrupt the landscape and create noise, especially near residential areas.
- Low capacity factor: Wind energy has a capacity factor of only 30%, making it less stable than other energy sources.
- Dependence on weather: Energy production depends on wind strength, leading to fluctuations in the energy supply.

[SecIntro]
SUSSANE:
Hi, my name is Susanne. I will be your â€˜spin doctorâ€™ on your journey to create Denmark's future energy supply.

Before we dive into using taxpayer money, itâ€™s important that you are well-prepared to make the right decisions.
When we talk about energy supply, there are countless factors at play that affect which solutions we can choose.
Itâ€™s complex, and it requires a lot of consideration. But donâ€™t worry! Iâ€™m here to make it easier for you.
To prevent you from getting completely grey-haired before we reach our goal, Iâ€™ve removed all the political, moral, and legal red tape.
We will focus only on five main factors: Price (P), Energy Production (E), COâ‚‚ Emissions (C), Stability (S), and Capacity Factor (K). Your success will be measured based on how well you balance the first three â€“ Price, Production, and COâ‚‚.

In short, the capacity factor is a measure of how efficiently an energy type utilizes its capacity. For example: If you have an energy source that can produce 10 MW, and the capacity factor is 90%, you will actually only get 9 MW of usable energy. So, itâ€™s an important key to understanding what you get for your money.
Well, youâ€™ve waited long enough now. Iâ€™ll let you do your thing. You can find me back at my office at Christiansborg.

Oh, and one last thing... I need you to answer a few questions before you get started!
