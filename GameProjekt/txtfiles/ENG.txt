[Intro]
Welcome to Power Simulator!
Thereâ€™s a lot of activity at Christiansborg leading up to the upcoming 2025 election, and your help is needed!
The Minister for the Environment wants to propose a draft for Denmarkâ€™s energy grid by 2030 as part of the Paris Agreement.
However, heâ€™s struggling to decide which direction to take when it comes to choosing energy sources.
Your task is to explore and determine which energy supply Denmark should use!
